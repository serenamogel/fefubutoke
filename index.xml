Halberds are basically longer versions of other weapons, often sacrificing speed for a bigger reach and power. And that remains true in Dark Souls 2 as well.
They also suffer from the same ‚ÄúSweetspot‚Äù curse as the reapers, meaning that if you don‚Äôt hit your target with the blade part of the weapon, you‚Äôll do reduced damage (though the penalty isn‚Äôt as harsh), so keep that in mind.</description></item><item><title>Western Digital Introduces WD Black SN750 SE SSD: Entry-Level PCIe Gen4</title><link>/western-digital-introduces-wd-black-sn750-se-ssd-entrylevel-pcie-gen4.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/western-digital-introduces-wd-black-sn750-se-ssd-entrylevel-pcie-gen4.html</guid><description>Among several announcements today, Western Digital is introducing a new more affordable PCIe Gen4 SSD under their gaming-oriented WD Black brand (styled WD_BLACK).
