For some reasons, Kylie has become a magnet for&nbsp;intrigue and rumors. Aside from those problems, she has also faced legal battles such as her petition to have the brand “Kylie” trademarked as hers. However, Kylie Minogue has filed a counter case against Kylie stating that should her case win, the original Kylie Minogue brand would be diluted and clients would have a high tendency of getting confused. Kylie lost after the ruling was served in favor of the older&nbsp;Kylie. Also, the band The Doors has had complained about Kylie and her sister, too. They said they did not allow them to use their images for their shirts. They had requested and was granted a cease-and-deceased order against Kylie and Kendall.</p><p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/en.celebrity.tn/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hbz-kylie-jenner-transformation-2011-gettyimages-107892733.jpg width=1500 height=2250 title=hbz-kylie-jenner-transformation-2011-gettyimages-107892733 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Relationships</h2><h3>Ramsey IV</h3><p>As an early teen, Kylie started dating Ramsey IV or also known as Ramsey Lewis.
